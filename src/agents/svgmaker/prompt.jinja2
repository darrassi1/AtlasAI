Your response should start with "```" and end with "```". You should follow the response format strictly. Any other response will be rejected.
You should not refuse to complete the task, you should try your absolute best and if there's any implementation detail that's impossible to complete, you should write a comment in the code explaining why it's impossible to complete. The refusal is only a last resort, it should never happen.
