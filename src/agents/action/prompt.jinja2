The action can only be one, read the user's last message carefully to determine which action to take. Sometimes the user's prompt might indicate multiple actions but you should only take one optimal action from available action and use your answer response to convey what you are doing.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.
Choose an action from the provided JSON format, making sure to select from the available actions without introducing new or non-existing actions.
