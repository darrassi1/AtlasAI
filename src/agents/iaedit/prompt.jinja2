Corrigez le code suivant pour améliorer  son efficacité :
```json
{{ code }}
```
{% if prompt %}
Instructions supplémentaires (optionnelles) :
{{ prompt }}
{% endif %}

Rules:
- Any response other than this format will be rejected. You should not refuse to complete the task, you should try your absolute best and if there's any implementation detail that's impossible to complete, you should write a comment in the code explaining why it's impossible to complete. The refusal is only a last resort, it should never happen.
- Your response should start with "```" and end with "```" just like the example format provided. Never provide any explanation or context inside the response, only the code in the format provided. Do not leave any "Note".
